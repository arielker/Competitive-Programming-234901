Notice that the relation mentioned in the problem is equivalent to the relation
between -
the maximal apothem of the k-gon not containing any point
and
the minimal apothem of the k-gon containing all points,
squared.
It's implied from geometry rules.

Fix a value of k and let p be one of the points.
Let rk(p) be the circumradius of the k-gon that has p on its perimeter.
we compute each value from trigonometry:
    Let (r, a) be the polar coordinates of p
    using rotational symmetry we can assume 0 <= a <= 2*pi/k.
    Then, rk(p) = r * (cos(a-pi/k) / cos(pi/k)).

We then sort all these rk(p)'s.

With all the rk(p) found, the answer can be computed with two simple loops.
Iterating over all possible k values from 3 to 8, each time in the end we save best score and the relevant k.
for every k -
    omega = pi / k
    theta = 2 * omega
    angle = theta
        for each (r,a) and while a <= angle:
        the apothem for each point equals r * cos(a + omega - angle)
    and we add 'theta' each time to 'angle' - (angle += theta).
pretty dirty geometry t.b.h. but luckily I'm a matriculation math tutor for 5 points :).

Time complexity:
- getting input and computing polar coords for each point: O(n).
- sort: O(n).
- 2 main loops: O(33 * n)
    3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 33.
