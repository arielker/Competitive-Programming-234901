The maximum value of the single-peak function is obtained by three points.
Hence, we may conduct a ternary search over all contestants speeds where
the lengths of the cycling and running courses change accordingly, to find optimal
running/cycling lengths to suit the cheater's speed - as much time difference as possible.

Set the first part length to x, the length of the second part is l-x,
time(x) = x/v + (l-x)/u.
we may notice that the above function is a single-peak function, so ternary search
is valid in this case.

Time complexity:
    n - number of contestants.
1. input processing - O(n).
2. ternary search where in each iteration we try to maximize the time difference - O(n log3(n)).
3. finding maximal difference in the end - O(n).
