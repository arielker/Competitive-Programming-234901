This is a known CS question, let's solve it with a classic DP method.
In this type of question, there is no connection between the input to the needed calculations.
Accordingly, we have done some preprocessing to get all the relevant option
(according to the mentioned bounds in the question).
The init phase is the only easily known fact- there is only one way to pay nothing.
The rest of the options are calculated based on two options- the first one is the last option and the sum bigger than the coins option.

After the preprocessing is done, we access the relevant value from the already filled cache.
