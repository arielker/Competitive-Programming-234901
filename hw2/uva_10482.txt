This question was a classic DP question.
Accordingly, to avoid redundant callings, we used a cache matrix.
The first step was to save the total candies weight- while summing the input.
Now, we have three children who want candies, so there are three options (give candy #X to child 1/2/3).
When no candies are left, the recursion returns the max differences between the children.
The overall minimum from all the options is the one who actually taken.

Classic DP question, no specialty :).
