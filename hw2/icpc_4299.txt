We define f(d,c) as probability of couple at distance d and cost c.
Then the solution is the sum of all probabilities f(d,i) from i to m, inclusive.
We can compute this function using DP where every step is defined by the sum
of all possible costs of the previous distance, or 0 if the distance is higher than
the cost.
Distances between all nodes are found using Floyd-Warshall.

Time complexity:
1. Input processing - O(n).
2. Floyd-Warshall - O(n^3).
3. DP calculation - O(n^2 * r^2).
4. Probabilities calculations - O(m).
